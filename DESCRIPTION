        First, review the meaning of the different components.
        Second, explore those components for real datasets.
        Third, users control the trend, seasonality, random effects to see how they combine into a full time series.
        Last, users are assis on their knowledge. 
LearningObjectives: c(
    "This application is to help you better understand trend, seasonality, and the random component of time series plots."
